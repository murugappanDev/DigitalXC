# Secret Santa Assignment System

## Overview
This project is a **Secret Santa assignment system** built with **React**. It allows users to upload two CSV filesâ€”one containing the list of current employees and another with last year's assignments. The system ensures that:

- Employees are randomly assigned a Secret Santa recipient.
- No one is assigned to themselves.
- Previous year assignments are avoided.
- The results can be downloaded as a new CSV file.

## Features
- ðŸ“‚ **CSV Upload**: Upload current employee list and previous year's assignments.
- ðŸ”„ **Shuffling Algorithm**: Ensures a fair and unique assignment.
- âœ… **Validation**: Checks for missing employees, incorrect file formats, and ensures a valid assignment.
- ðŸ“¤ **Downloadable Output**: Exports the final Secret Santa assignments as a CSV file.
- ðŸ›  **Error Handling**: Alerts users when assignments fail or files are invalid.

## CSV File Format

## Error Handling
- If an **invalid CSV format** is uploaded, an alert will notify the user.
- If **no valid assignment** is possible (e.g., circular dependencies), a retry mechanism will attempt to reshuffle.
- If the **shuffling algorithm fails after multiple attempts**, the user will be notified.
